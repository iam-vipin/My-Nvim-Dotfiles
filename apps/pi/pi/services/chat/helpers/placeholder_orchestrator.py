TASK: Extract complete entity information for a specific entity

ENTITY TO FIND: {entity_type} named "{entity_name}"

CONTEXT (Tool execution results):
```json
{escaped_context}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
You must extract ALL of the following fields for the requested entity:
1. entity_type - The type of entity (e.g., "project", "cycle", "workitem")
2. entity_name - The exact name of the entity as it appears in the context
3. entity_id - The UUID of the entity (format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
4. entity_identifier - The short identifier/slug (e.g., "PROJ") if available, null if not

CRITICAL RULES:
- entity_id is ALWAYS a UUID (36 characters with hyphens)
- entity_identifier is a SHORT code like "MOTO" or "PROJ" (or null if not present)
- DO NOT confuse these two! They are completely different fields!
- Look in the entity_info or entity section of the context

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
```json
{{{{
  "entity_type": "project",
  "entity_name": "Motor Bike",
  "entity_id": "acf5c262-790b-4a15-bd56-501bb8863968",
  "entity_identifier": "MOTO"
}}}}
```

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
- You may wrap it in markdown code blocks if needed
- All fields are required except entity_identifier (can be null)
- Make sure the entity_id is the UUID, NOT the identifier!
