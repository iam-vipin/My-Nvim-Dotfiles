Two issues are duplicates if they:
1. Address the same core problem or request
2. Have substantially similar goals or objectives
3. Would require the same or very similar solution
4. Are not just related but actually requesting the same functionality

Return the serial numbers of duplicate candidates, not their IDs."""  # noqa: E501

# Here are 10 candidate issues (id, title):

# Return a JSON array of the ids that describe the SAME problem

# If none are duplicates return [].

# Think step-by-step *briefly* before you output the JSON.
